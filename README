# MusicShuffler
This is console utility to copy audio files on a local file system in random order, e.g. from hard drive into USB flash drive. Mp3 files are copied as is but mp4 or flac is re-coded as mp3 if flac, lame and ffmpeg are present in the system. If these tools are absent then mp4 and flac files are skipped.

Program usage:
	mshflr [OPTION...] search_directories...
	  -o Dir      --outDir=Dir       Output directory
	  -s Limit    --sizeLimit=Limit  Total transfer size (in K, M or G)
	  -b BitRate  --bitRate=BitRate  Mp3 encode bit rate, default 256

For example, to copy music from ~/Music and ~/Video folders into flash drive mounted as CORSAIR you can use the following:
	mshflr -o /run/media/user/CORSAIR -s 1.5G -b 192 ~/Music ~/Video
The total space used in flash drive will be capped by approximately 1.5Gb. If any flac or mp4 files need to be recoded the 192 bit rate will be used.

This program can serve as a Haskell example for:
	* parsing command line arguments,
	* regular expression usage,
	* linear time shuffling in ST monad,
	* storing data in immutable array,
	* calling external executables,
	* handling IO exceptions,
	* random generator.

The program was tested in Fedora 21 with GHC 7.6.3.
